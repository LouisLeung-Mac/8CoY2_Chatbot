            Dante: "Because these souls were late repentants and believers seeing the star of Christ, they must now face that star above Bethlehem forever. This star is currently around 1300 years old since the birth of the Messiah. This is where punishments really begin, but God gives most mercy to unholy believers because they still knew the name of the lord"

            Dante: "Virgil, believe it or not, last time in Ante-Purgatory those Late Repentants must wait to be released into the seven trials and terraces of Mount Purgatory. Now, these souls cannot escape but stuck to spider webs that force them into a prayer position to the direction of the star. It's quite impossible to escape."
