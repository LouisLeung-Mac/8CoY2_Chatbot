            Dante: "Because these souls were late repentants and believers seeing the star of Christ, they must now face that star above Bethlehem forever. This star is currently around 1300 years old since the birth of the Messiah. This is where punishments really begin, but God gives most mercy to unholy believers because they still knew the name of the Lord Emmanuel."

            Dante: "Virgil, believe it or not, last time in Ante-Purgatory those Late Repentants must wait to be released into the seven trials and terraces of Mount Purgatory. Now, these souls cannot escape but stuck to spider webs that force them into a prayer position to the direction of the star. It's quite impossible to escape."

            Dante: "Whoa, look at this particular soul. Standing up just to pray, seems as if he's so significant he can't even rest by not standing. Yet I feel glad he won't feel the coldness on his calves others would."

            Dante: "*prays* Gracious God, in times of trouble and despair, we turn to You as our refuge and strenght, including Virgil himself since now then for his time in Limbo and as my guide for the Inferno and Mount Purgatory. Hear those late repentants' cries, O Lord, and incline Your ear to their supplications. Grant them the assurance through Jesus' name, for they will remain strong despite their weakness in punishment for their afterlife, and one day in Judgement day shall they ascend to Purgatory whilst the damned will be thrown into Gehenna by your plans. Amen."

            Dante: "Shall we move on with our boat."
