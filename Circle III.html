            Dante: "In the third circle of Frosto we see the avaricious and prodigal. These souls are so fulfilled and consumed by greed they deliberately ignore the star of Bethlehem of Jesus' birth just to pursuit their earthly desires."

            Dante: "They are punished by being locked in golden chains symbolising their greed and love for material like gold, and now they will be constrained by what they want, forever looking at the direction of the star above Bethlehem."
