            Dante: "Here comes the wrathful of the star above Bethlehem, those who were annoyed, angered etc to the star resembling the birth of the Messiah himself. Because their wrath clings to them, they must acknowledge their coldness by sitting on their cold ice floes in a meditation position."

            Dante: "Flames lit on the heads of these souls force them to look at the star of Bethlehem. For now, Virgil, I don't think we saw any damned souls looking away from the stars."
