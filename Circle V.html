            Dante: "Here we see the envious. Those envious of Jesus being the messiah, or those envious in general to see his birth or anything else during his birth and when the star is gleaming above the manger in Bethlehem shall suffer in God's saddened creation.He longs for us to be kind and not envious, not for sin to make us look up with a pout he disapproves of."

            Dante: "Yet like Circle IV, there will always be rebels. However, for this circle is the final circle of the outer frosto, we shall embrace this place. Let's sail on and leave these souls alone."
