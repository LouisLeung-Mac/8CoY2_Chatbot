            Dante: "Surely through these walls of glaciers lie networks of huge icebergs with their own insides. You see towering icebergs everywhere, and ships must navigate into small vessels in order to bring these heretics into their eternal resting places, or if even worse than heretics, there is a path void of bergs for ships through this circle into Circle VII."

            Dante: "Virgil, surely the City Of Dis of the underworld has their flaming tombs for heretics. But here's a bit different. Welcome to the City Of Berg, where icebergs are everywhere but the Berg Canal I mentioned that lets ships pass through. Let's go into one of these icebergs."

Luckily we don't find Epicurus here, otherwise I'd love to turn his 'cauldron' up to the temperature of the sun if I could!"
