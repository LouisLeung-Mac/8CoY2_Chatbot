            Dante: "Ahh, for our ship has reached the seventh circle. Surrounding the whole outer circumference of the circle are angel guards with bows, ready to shoot anyone who tries to escape into the warmth of the City Of Bergs with those boiling cauldrons."

            Dante: "Virgil, the freezing seas in front of us for some reason lack the typical icebergs, floes or ice sheets we see in the other circles. And yet we are met with much more treacherous waves worse than the North Sea, and to make matters worse, there are water pulses shooting out of these waves and waters like jets that can pack a fatal punch."

            Dante: "For those who murdered during Christmas showed their coldness and ignored the birth of the Messiah, they will now dwelve in God's fury at their violence against others. Their coldness to the star and their victim, as well as their pain of violence makes them drown under these treacherous waves."
