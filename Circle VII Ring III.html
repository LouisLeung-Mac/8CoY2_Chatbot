            Dante: "Ahh, surely Christmas is quite the worst time to mock God, and those are the souls who exactly did that during the birth of the Messiah. For the Lord granted us art, nature and elves, pygmies etc in the world, for Christmas is to celebrate the birth of the Messiah, and yet some used violent mouths to curse at God, art or nature during a time of importance. What foolish damned souls they are, and they will now suffer the wrath of God."

            Dante: "Welcome, Virgil to the Seas Of The Blasphemers. They will now suffer in these tiny islands sticking out, which means we are close to land, but in the middle of the Arctic? You'll see later."
            <img src="IMG_8895.jpeg">
            Dante: "God's wrath now pours onto them with thunder, treacherous waves of freezing temperature and harsh blizzards that roar and rampage across the seas, devastating these souls."
            <img src="IMG_8896.jpeg">
            Dante: "The winds, gusts and hail are so strong I can't even feel myself! Where is this ship even heading to!?"

            Hours and perhaps a day later...

            Dante: "Ahh, we've finally reached land and escaped those treacherous seas! But no way there's land in the middle of the north pole when it's void of elves and pygmies, what could be inside?"

            Dante: "Well, it's 1300 and I've certainly never seen moving carts like this, nor do you, Virgil! What the hell are these?"

            Sign: 'Train Station - Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Your Punishments...'

            Dante: "Ahh, so it's called a train? Interesting thing, I've gotta say!"

            You, Virgil work together with Dante to persuade the elf guards to let you two into the guards' longue of the train as both of you board

            You and Dante enter the train into the guards' longue, unaware of the cars behind holding the punished dead souls locked in chains:

            Dante: "Surely these elf guards are quite nice to newcomers, unlike the fallen angels in hell who tried to kill us with Medusa once we reached the gates of Dis!"

            The train starts moving as it heads away...
