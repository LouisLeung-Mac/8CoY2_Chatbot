            Dante: "Ahh, surely Christmas is quite the worst time to mock God, and those are the souls who exactly did that during the birth of the Messiah. For the Lord granted us art, nature and elves, pygmies etc in the world, for Christmas is to celebrate the birth of the Messiah, and yet some used violent mouths to curse at God, art or nature during a time of importance. What foolish damned souls they are, and they will now suffer the wrath of God."

            Dante: "Welcome, Virgil to the Seas Of The Blasphemers. They will now suffer in these tiny islands sticking out, which means we are close to land, but in the middle of the Arctic? You'll see later."

            Dante: "God's wrath now pours onto them with thunder, treacherous waves of freezing temperature and harsh blizzards that roar and rampage across the seas, devastating these souls."

            Dante: "The winds, gusts and hail are so strong I can't even feel myself! Where is this ship even heading to!?"

            Hours and perhaps a day later...

            Dante: "Ahh, we've finally reached land and escaped those treacherous seas! But no way there's land in the middle of the north pole when it's void of elves and pygmies, what could be inside?"
