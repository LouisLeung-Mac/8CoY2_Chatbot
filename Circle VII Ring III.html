            Dante: "Ahh, surely Christmas is quite the worst time to mock God, and those are the souls who exactly did that during the birth of the Messiah. For the Lord granted us art, nature and elves, pygmies etc in the world, for Christmas is to celebrate the birth of the Messiah, and yet some used violent mouths to curse at God, art or nature during a time of importance. What foolish damned souls they are, and they will now suffer the wrath of God."
