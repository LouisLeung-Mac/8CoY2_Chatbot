        <h1>Dante's Frosto, the chilling Inferno for the damned during the birth of Jesus</h1>
        <h3><p>From pagans who saw but ignored the star or never realised the star, to those wrathful, violent etc of the star must suffer here in the afterlife</h3></p>
        <p>
        Dante: "It's December of 1300 and I find myself in the middle of the north after travelling to the northern points of Europe via an angel, whilst the chilling cold bites me and you, Virgil, after my descent from Paradise and your ascent from Limbo whilst I was in Paradise. Though the mountains and snowy plains I see the ocean beyon me, frozen with dwelling seals."

        <p> Dante: "Ah, what goofy seals they are. Rolling and tumbling around on the ice. Virgil, I am unfamiliar wigth this place so shall you decide our route. Which direciton should we go?" <a href="call an angel and fly to Svalbard.html"></a> or <a href="back to a nearby village south in Norway.html"></a></p>
