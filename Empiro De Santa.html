            You suddenly see a huge icy wall out of the towers, known to the elves as the walls of Santa. The never ending walls circle up Circle VIII and the whole capital of the north pole, with all sorts of architectural features from gleaming slippery ice pillars, shards and sculptures to chiseled and abstract patterns that represent the ice. The walls of Santa despite being ice seems to be the height of the Walls Of Dis, and the huge ice gate, with a Santa statue on top, seems like the height of Phlegyas or even the giants like Nimrod or Anatues.

            Dante: "Well it seems like we arrived, and the elves are quite mean as they won't let us through the gates. Guess all we have is a map guide here..."
