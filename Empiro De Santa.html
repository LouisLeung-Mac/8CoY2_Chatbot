            You suddenly see a huge icy wall out of the towers, known to the elves as the walls of Santa. The never ending walls circle up Circle VIII and the whole capital of the north pole, with all sorts of architectural features from gleaming slippery ice pillars, shards and sculptures to chiseled and abstract patterns that represent the ice. The walls of Santa despite being ice seems to be the height of the Walls Of Dis, and the huge ice gate, with a Santa statue on top, seems like the height of Phlegyas or even the giants like Nimrod or Anatues.

            You finally arrive as the wall towers over you as if you were entering a new dimension, and you board off the train with Dante and the elf guards whilst they get the damned souls off, torturing them into the gates that tower like a statue that not even King Minos could open...

            Welcome to the Empiro De Santa, the capital of the north pole. At the center is where Santa's ice skyscraper that touches the clouds like a stuck-out architectural shard with some curves and a huge balcony platform like what we now call Jeddah Tower, standing at around the height of the Tower Of Babel even we could see it from a distance and that even the walls couldn't hide such a skyscraper of ice!

            Dante: "Well it seems like we arrived, and the elves are quite mean as they won't let us through the gates. Guess all we have is a map guide here..."

            Dante: "Great, now we have to wait. There's no way we're getting through this gate soon..."

            You, Virgil and Dante decided to wait at the chilling walls just to admire the architecture until the elves let you in.
