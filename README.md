         <h1>Dante's Frosto, the chilling Inferno for the Jesus haters</h1>
         <h3><p>Those wrathful, sullen and violent, fraudulent etc of Jesus' birth and himself must be punished outside the Inferno....</h3></p>

         Dante: "It's December of 1300 and I find myself in the middle of the arctic after travelling to the northern points of Norway via an angel, whilst the chilling cold bites me and you, Virgil after my descent from Paradise and his ascent from Limbo whilst I was in Paradise. Through the mountains and snowy plains I see the ocean beyond me, frozen with dwelling seals."
         </p>

         <p> Dante: "Ah, what goofy seals they are. Rolling and tumbling around on the ice. Virgil, I am unfamiliar with this place so shall you decide our route. Which direction should we go?" <a href="">call an angel and fly to Svalbard</a> or <a href="">back to Norway</a></p>
