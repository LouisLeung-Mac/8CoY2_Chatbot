         <h1>Dante's Frosto, the chilling Inferno for the Jesus haters</h1>
         <h3><p>Those wrathful, sullen and violent, fraudulent etc of Jesus' birth and himself must be punished outside the Inferno....</h3></p>

         Dante: "It's December of 1300 and I find myself in the middle of the arctic after travelling to the northern points of Norway, whilst the chilling cold bites me and Virgil after my descent from Paradise and his ascent from Limbo whilst I was in Paradise. Through the mountains and snowy plains I see the ocean beyond me, frozen with dwelling seals."
