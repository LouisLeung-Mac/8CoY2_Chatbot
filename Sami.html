            Dante: "Ah, Virgil, it seems like we're heading back to Florence via Lappland. Are we seriously going to cross the North Sea via boat and cross a strait near England just to travel through the Iberian Peninsula and return to Florence? I had enough of celebrating Christmas with my family, I want adventure and it's literally December of 1300!"
