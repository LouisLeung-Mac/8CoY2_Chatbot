            Dante: "Ahh, what a coincidence to see, beyond south of Purgatory, though not the opposite shall be north. Shall I say, virtuous pagans we sail through this first circle of Frosto, those who rejected, ignored or were ignorant of the star that shone to Jesus Christ's birth in Bethlehem, shall stay here forever. Welcome to Limbo Di Frosto, Virgil."
