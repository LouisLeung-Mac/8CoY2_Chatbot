            Dante: "Sail with me through the icebergs of the piers of the Frosto, Virgil. Be my guide as we reach the first circle's pier."

            Dante: "Ahh, what a coincidence to see, beyond south of Purgatory, though not the opposite should be north. Shall I say, virtuous pagans we sail through this first circle of Frosto, those who rejected, ignored or were ignorant of the star that shone to Jesus Christ's birth in Bethlehem, shall stay here forever. Welcome to Limbo Di Frosto, Virgil."

            As the sun sets into night, you, Virgil and Dante find yourselves amidst a large ice sheet in the numerous ice sheets of circle I.

            Dante: "Those ignorant or did things resulting in their afterlife here during the time they saw or are oblivious to Jesus' birth will stare at a star that shines above Bethlehem forever, having desperation to meet the messiah himself since they never realised, met him etc in his lifetime being nonbelievers."

            Dante: "Here, we see wrenched souls in despair and hopelessness, Virgil, just like those in Limbo of the underworld. This soul seems particularly yearning and unyielding, gazing at the bright star that radiates and roars brighter than all others and the moon."
